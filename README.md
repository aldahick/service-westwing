# service-westwing

Scrapes [westwingtranscripts.com](https://www.westwingtranscripts.com) to provide a standardized interface to get West Wing transcripts.

Might do more eventually.

Currently used by [wasp-server](https://github.com/aldahick/wasp-server) (and therefore, [wasp-web](https://github.com/aldahick/wasp-web)).

The scraped data is live at [my personal website](https://alexhicks.net/westwing/episodes).
